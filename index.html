        <p>1941, A physicist and his wife are traveling north on US Highway 99 north of Bakersfield, California, 
		and pull off to the side to watch a long, slender object of a blazing red, green, and yellow color 
		moving about 8 miles east of them. It is traveling at about 50 mph at an altitude of 200–300 feet 
		and is clearly outlined against the foothills. It seems to be several times longer than a bomber.

      <div class="body">
        <p>1947, June 24 — 3:00 p.m. Boise, Idaho, businessman Kenneth Arnold, flying his CallAir Model A-2 from Chehalis to
Yakima, Washington, sees a string of nine objects flying in an echelon formation past Mount Rainier,
Washington. At first he assumes they are jets, but he can see no trails. They cover the 50-mile distance between
Rainier and another peak in 1 minute 42 seconds. He estimates their speed to be at least 1,200 mph. The objects
swerve in and out of the smaller peaks, flipping from side to side in unison, dipping, and presenting their lateral
surfaces, which reflect the bright sunlight and cause the flashes he saw earlier. They are in view for about two and
a half minutes and are last seen heading south over the last high peak of Mount Adams. Arnold tells the airport
staff about it in Yakima at 4:00 p.m. and they call ahead to Pendleton, Oregon, to alert them of Arnold’s arrival at
an air show and his story. A large crowd awaits him, and a discussion follows. The consensus is that Arnold has
seen guided missiles. But no such technology exists at the time that can match the objects’ description and
performance, and the late 1990s explanation that Arnold observed a flight of white pelicans is equally improbable.
Researcher Martin Shough concludes in 2010: “Examination of the sighting report in detail improves its evident
internal consistency, rather than degrading it, and study of the principal contending explanations reveals that they
are each very much less attractive when tried out in quantitative detail against the best information than they may
appear at first sight.” (Wikipedia, “Kenneth Arnold UFO Sighting”; [Project Blue Book file]; NICAP, “Kenneth

        <p>1947,July 5 — Following the rain the night before, Brazel inspects the pastures surrounding the J. B. Foster ranch house
southeast of Corona, New Mexico. Riding with him is the young son of the Proctors, William D. Proctor. During
the inspection, Brazel discovers a large debris field. Scattered on the slopes and into the sinkhole and depressions
are plastic-like beams, pieces of lightweight balsawood-like material only stronger, light metallic foil (which
doesn’t stay bent or folded, resumes its original shape, and won’t tear), and heavy-gauge monofilament. The
debris is thick enough that the sheep refuse to cross the field and are driven around it to water more than a mile
away. Brazel, taking a few scraps of the material, heads to the home of his closest neighbors, Floyd and Loretta
Proctor. He shows them “a little sliver” of material that he can neither burn nor cut. Some of the beams have
symbols on them that reminds Brazel of Chinese ideograms. The Proctors suggest he take it into town to show the
sheriff. (Don Schmitt and Kevin D. Randle, “Did a Balloon Crash at Roswell?” IUR 15, no. 4 (July/Aug. 1990):

        <p>1950, March 17 — 9:15 a.m.–noon. About a dozen shiny “saucer-like discs” appear above Farmington, New Mexico, zip
around for 10 minutes then move off to the northeast. At 10:30 a.m., a red object is joined by three silvery discs
and put on a “dogfight.” At 11:15 a.m., a huge swarm comes into view. Former Army Engineer captain and
Farmington Times business manager Clayton J. Boddy Jr. is walking on Broadway Avenue with two friends when
he sees a large cluster of 50–100 objects moving at high speed. Private pilot John Eaton sees a red object at the
center of the formation of silvery discs, which appear to be twice the size of a B-29 bomber. Some estimates say
that the UFOs are seen by half the town’s population, or about 3,000 people, for 20 minutes. Harold F. Thatcher,
director of the Farmington branch of the US Soil Conservation Service, triangulates one disc’s flight and
calculates it is traveling at 1,000 mph. After maneuvering in formation, they speed away at a height of 15,000–
20,000 feet. (NICAP, “The Farmington Invasion”; Sparks, p. 84; “Farmington ‘Invaded’ by Saucer Squadron,”

        <p>During interception exercises, seven MiG-12s from the Mierzęcice Air Base [now Katowice 
        Airport], Poland, notice a saucer-shaped object with flashing lights approaching them. It 
        has a blue-gray cupola on top and is three times bigger than any of the aircraft. It flies 
        to each of the MiGs and maneuvers around them. (Poland 65)</p>
        <p>January — 11:00 p.m. A Brazilian electronics businessman and 9 others see a disc-shaped 
        object shine a light down on the water near the eastern bank of the Rio Tapajós 30 miles 
        south of Santarém, Brazil. The man, his family, and some relatives are camping at a beach. 
        Several teenagers are still awake, lying in hammocks and talking, when they see the UFO come 
        across the river, stopping about 30 yards from the beach and shining a light on the water 60 
        feet below. The UFO hovers briefly then begins moving north, parallel to the shore. It travels 
        more than half a mile, with the spotlight shining straight down before it disappears. The light 
        beam leaves a trail of luminescence for several hundred yards. (Bob Pratt, UFO Danger Zone:

		<p>February 13 — 9:32 p.m. A witness is in his living room at Ada, Oklahoma, when he notices 
		that his son has driven onto his property, but his car has stopped near the gate about 300 feet 
		east of the house. He sits there about 10 minutes before coming inside and tells his father to 
		come outside and look at two objects, one diamond-shaped some 300 feet above the ground and a 
		doughnut-shaped object about 150 feet up and 100 feet west of the diamond. Both are a dull-orange 
		color, silent, and about 900 feet away. After 10 minutes, the larger diamond-shaped object (about 
		the size of a Boeing 727) begins moving slowly to the east, passing behind some trees before it 
		rises to an elevation of about 700–800 feet, hovering for another 10 minutes. It then moves east 
		and climbs to 1,000 feet, then moves north to 1,500 feet and begins flashing. It moves north and 
		disappears. The doughnut-shaped object is still stationary and seems to fade away. (Roger Marsh, “
